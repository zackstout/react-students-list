# React Students List
Copying base project from Prime's repo. Use `npm run server` to spin up the server and `npm run client` to spin up the client.

Note to self: do *not* mess with the value of `proxy` in the `package.json`. It seems that when you initialize your project it fixes what you write there in an irrevocable way. Or at least I couldn't revoke it.
